 Timepoke Log - A log documenting what I did to create time poke.

   Spent most of the day brainstorming the features I wanted, and
   thought a bit about the stack I want to use. Worked on business
   cases, table design, wireframes. Showed Soren. He proposed a
   different approach which simplified things. I agreed it seemed
   better so I took another shot at wireframes and then did new
   tables based on them, and finally code organization.

   structure.

   Got the login page basically how I want it. No server side 
   components yet. Compiling less code with twitter recess:
     recess main.less --compile > main.css
   No build scripts of any kind yet. Also, ready for my first
   git checkin.
